My name is Kshitiz Gupta. I currently work a Deep Learning Solutions Architect in NVIDIA solving problems in Conversational AI, Computer Vision, Tabular Data Science and GPU Machine Learning in general. I studied Statistics and Computer Science at UC Berkeley.

I started ML Safari to share my excitement about Machine Learning. I am still learning myself, but I found that writing posts and tutorials is the best way to deepen my own understanding. Topics I am currently excited about are Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision and Graph Data Science, so these will account for most of the posts on here. 

I enjoy traveling and exploring different parts of the world. So far I’ve lived in 4 different countries (India, UAE, Saudi Arabia and US). I am happy to help in any way I can so don’t hesitate to [get in touch!](mailto:kshtzgupta1997@gmail.com)
