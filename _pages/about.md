My name is Kshitiz Gupta. I currently work a Solutions Architect at NVIDIA solving problems in GPU Deep Learning. I studied Statistics and Computer Science at UC Berkeley.

I started ML Safari to share my excitement about Machine Learning. I am still learning myself, but I found that writing posts and tutorials is the best way to deepen my own understanding. Topics I am currently excited about are Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision and Graph Data Science, so these will account for most of the posts on here. Occassionally, you might see posts about interesting stuff in Python, MLOps, and HPC.

I am happy to help in any way I can so donâ€™t hesitate to [get in touch!](mailto:kshtzgupta1997@gmail.com)
