            "content": "Let&#39;s first import the standard libraries . import torch from torch import nn, optim from torchvision import datasets, transforms from torch.utils.data import DataLoader import numpy as np . Load Data . We will use the MNIST dataset which is a handwritten digits dataset. It contains 60000 training and 10000 testing grayscale 28x28 images from 10 classes (0-9 digits): . . Before defining the dataloader we need to think of batch size. We set training batch size to 64. When you are using a GPU, the maximum batch size is dictated by the memory on the GPU. We’ll use a batch size for the validation set that is twice as large as that for the training set. This is because the validation set does not need backpropagation and thus takes less memory (it doesn’t need to store the gradients). We take advantage of this to use a larger batch size and compute the loss more quickly. . train_dataset = datasets.MNIST(&#39;./data&#39;, train=True, download=True, transform=transforms.ToTensor()) # Validation dataset validation_dataset = datasets.MNIST(&#39;./data&#39;, train=False, transform=transforms.ToTensor()) # Batch size : How many images are used to calculate the gradient batch_size = 64 # Train DataLoader train_loader = DataLoader(dataset=train_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True) # Validation DataLoader val_loader = DataLoader(dataset=validation_dataset, batch_size=2*batch_size, shuffle=False) . Create the MLP . Here we define the multi layer perceptron. It has 2 hidden layers with 512 units. Also note that the input layer has 28x28 nodes which is the size of the flattened data. Given below is the schematic diagram of the network. . . Using Functional API . class functionalMLP(nn.Module): def __init__(self, n_input, n_hid1, n_hid2, n_output): super().__init__() self.hidden1 = nn.Linear(n_input, n_hid1) self.hidden2 = nn.Linear(n_hid1, n_hid2) self.output = nn.Linear(n_hid2, n_output) self.relu = nn.ReLU() def forward(self, x): # x shape is [batch_size, 1, 28, 28] batch_size = x.shape[0] x = x.view(batch_size, -1) # x shape is [batch_size, 28*28] x = self.relu(self.hidden1(x)) x = self.relu(self.hidden2(x)) x = self.output(x) return x . model_functional = functionalMLP(n_input=28*28, n_hid1=512, n_hid2=512, n_output=10) . Loss function . Since this is classification problem we can use the Cross Entropy Loss available in PyTorch as nn.CrossEntropyLoss . loss_func = nn.CrossEntropyLoss() . Optimizer . We define the optimizer as SGD using learning rate of 1e-2 . def get_opt(model, lr=0.001): opt = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=lr) return opt . opt = get_opt(model_functional) . Training . We will define a loss_batch function that encapsulates the backpropogation process for training and loss calculation for validation. This function will also calculate accuracy for us. . def loss_batch(logits, y_batch, loss_func, opt=None): # calculate loss loss = loss_func(logits, y_batch) # calculate accuracy preds = logits.argmax(dim=1) acc = (preds == y_batch).sum() # only if we are training then perform the weights update if opt is not None: loss.backward() opt.step() opt.zero_grad() return loss.item(), acc.item() . Next we define a fit function that can handle both training and validation . def fit(epochs, train_loader, val_loader, model, loss_func, opt): for ep in range(epochs): # Training train_losses = [] train_n_correct = 0 model.train() for x_batch, y_batch in train_loader: logits = model(x_batch) loss, acc = loss_batch(logits, y_batch, loss_func, opt) train_losses.append(loss) train_n_correct += acc train_loss = np.sum(train_losses)/len(train_loader) train_acc = train_n_correct/len(train_loader.dataset) # Validation model.eval() val_losses = [] val_n_correct = 0 with torch.no_grad(): for x_batch, y_batch in val_loader: logits = model(x_batch) loss, acc = loss_batch(logits, y_batch, loss_func) val_losses.append(loss) val_n_correct += acc val_loss = np.sum(val_losses)/len(val_loader) val_acc = val_n_correct/len(val_loader.dataset) print(f&quot;Epoch {ep}:, TrainLoss: {train_loss:.2f}, TrainAcc: {train_acc:.2f}, ValLoss: {val_loss:.2f}, ValAcc: {val_acc:.2f} &quot;) . Now we are ready to begin our model training! We will train for 5 epochs: . epochs=5 fit(epochs, train_loader, val_loader, model_functional, loss_func, opt) . Epoch 0:, TrainLoss: 2.28, TrainAcc: 0.32, ValLoss: 2.25, ValAcc: 0.55 Epoch 1:, TrainLoss: 2.22, TrainAcc: 0.63, ValLoss: 2.18, ValAcc: 0.68 Epoch 2:, TrainLoss: 2.14, TrainAcc: 0.69, ValLoss: 2.07, ValAcc: 0.71 Epoch 3:, TrainLoss: 1.98, TrainAcc: 0.71, ValLoss: 1.86, ValAcc: 0.73 Epoch 4:, TrainLoss: 1.73, TrainAcc: 0.73, ValLoss: 1.55, ValAcc: 0.75 . Using Sequential API . nn.Sequential is a handy class we can use to simplify our code. A Sequential object runs each of the modules contained within it, in a sequential manner. This is a simpler way of writing our MLP. . To take advantage of this, we need to be able to easily define a custom layer from a given function. For instance, PyTorch doesn’t have a view layer, and we need to create one for our network. Lambda will create a layer that we can then use when defining a network with Sequential. . class Lambda(nn.Module): def __init__(self, func): super().__init__() self.func = func def forward(self, x): return self.func(x) def preprocess(x): return x.view(x.shape[0], -1) . Now we create the model using nn.Sequential . model_sequential = nn.Sequential( Lambda(preprocess), nn.Linear(784, 512), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(512, 512), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(512, 10)) . And that&#39;s it! This model defined using nn.Sequential is equivalent to the one we defined using Functional API. We re-use the fit and loss_batch functions defined above to train the model: . epochs=5 opt = get_opt(model_sequential) fit(epochs, train_loader, val_loader, model_sequential, loss_func, opt) . Epoch 0:, TrainLoss: 2.28, TrainAcc: 0.25, ValLoss: 2.26, ValAcc: 0.39 Epoch 1:, TrainLoss: 2.23, TrainAcc: 0.47, ValLoss: 2.20, ValAcc: 0.56 Epoch 2:, TrainLoss: 2.16, TrainAcc: 0.58, ValLoss: 2.10, ValAcc: 0.63 Epoch 3:, TrainLoss: 2.03, TrainAcc: 0.64, ValLoss: 1.93, ValAcc: 0.69 Epoch 4:, TrainLoss: 1.82, TrainAcc: 0.69, ValLoss: 1.66, ValAcc: 0.72 .

About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
